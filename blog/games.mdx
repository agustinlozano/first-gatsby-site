A **role-playing video game** (commonly referred to as simply a **role-playing game** or **RPG**, 
as well as a **computer role-playing game or CRPG**) is a video game genre where the player 
controls the actions of a character (or several party members) immersed in some well-defined 
world, usually involving some form of character development by way of recording statistics. 

Many role-playing video games have origins in tabletop role-playing games[1] and use much of 
the same terminology, settings and game mechanics.

Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, 
player character development, complexity, as well as replay value and immersion.

The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. 
RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences.
